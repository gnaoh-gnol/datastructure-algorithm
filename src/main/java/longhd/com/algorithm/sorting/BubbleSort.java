/**
 * Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by
 * swapping the items between them if they are in wrong order.
 * Average-case complexity of the Bubble Sort is Ðž(n2) and
 * The best-case complexity is O(n). That's the case where the data is already sorted.
 * small data set = ok-ish.
 * large data set = bad.
