/**
 * The hash data structure in Java uses the special hash function, which maps elements to a specific address where
 * they are stored.
 * Advantages:
 *      + The hash function helps in fetching elements in a constant time.
 *      + An efficient way to store element.
 * Disadvantages:
 *      + Collision resolution increases complexity.
 * Hashing suitable for the application needs constant time fetching.
 * When collisions occur, two techniques—chaining and open addressing—are used to resolve them.
